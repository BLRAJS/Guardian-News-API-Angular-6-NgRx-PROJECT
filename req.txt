One-page news application that will list recent articles from The
Guardian’s API (open-platform.theguardian.com) and display an article selected by a user.
You can obtain a free API key from the site or follow this link.https://bonobo.capi.gutools.co.uk/register/developer
Your application must use Angular. You are not expected to write the set-up code therefore
you should use the Angular CLI.
The app should have two components, an Article Component and a List Component.
The Article Component should display:
• the most recent article (if no article has been selected).
• the article selected by the user.

The List Component should display an array of the most recent articles (10 will be suffi-
cient).

When a user clicks on an article in the List Component that article should be displayed
in the Article Component.
Your application has to provide a state management pattern in order to store your data in
a single place. Use NgRx to accomplish this requirement.
You should follow the general layout indicated by the wireframe in Figure 1. Styling and
additional content you wish to include is left to you.
The app should work on all modern browsers (Chrome, IE10, Firefox & Safari), there is no
need to support outdated browsers.
